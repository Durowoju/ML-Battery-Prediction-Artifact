## 📘 Project Description  
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the performance of **solid-state electrolyte (SSE) lithium batteries doped with various materials**. Using structured electrochemical data—including **impedance (Z’ and Z’’), ionic conductivity, temperature effects, voltage profiles, and current density**—the models evaluate how dopant composition influences overall battery behavior.

The study implements and compares several ML algorithms:

- **Nonlinear Regression**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Gradient Boosting Regression**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **LSTM Neural Networks** (for sequential predictions)

These models were trained and validated on experimental EIS datasets representing multiple doped electrolyte materials (Mo-doped, Ce-doped, Li3InCl4.8F1.2, LINH316_Labmade, and others). Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieved strong predictive performance due to their ability to model nonlinear relationships and handle noisy electrochemical measurements.

This project helps identify which dopant-material combinations produce the highest ionic conductivity and most stable electrochemical response—supporting improved battery design and performance optimization.
